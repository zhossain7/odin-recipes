<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin
  consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped
  with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies,
  mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a
  high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is
  sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

<p>
  In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten
  with the use of a knife and fork.[2][3] In casual settings, however, it is cut
  into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.
